     <h1> Hello Welcome to the world of possibilities</h1>  <hr>
    
        <p> Today I worked on building and styling a webpage using HTML, CSS, and
           JavaScript inside Visual Studio Code.
          Through this task,
          
          I learned how small changes in code can completely transform a website's 
          layout and interactivity
        This hands-on experience helped me 
        improve my understanding of web structure, styling principles,
         and debugging workflow -
        all while strengthening my confidence
        in front-end development.
        Excited to keep learning and exploring new
         technologies in the web development journey !</p>

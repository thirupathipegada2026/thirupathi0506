WEB DEVELOPMENT WITH VIBE CODING 

Today l learnt and I explored the topics
It Includes :
👉Client server Architecture 
👉Databases
👉Http Methods
👉Http Requests
👉CRUD Operations
👉 Application programming interface (API)

Topic: CLIENT SERVER ARCHITECTURE 

💬CLIENT : Users side 
It means the request that we raise through any web or app 
Example: Swiggy - Here we can order something or requesting order from the specified restaurant 

,💬SERVER : It means the server give Response for users request 
In another words Server is a super computer which holds the data and give the response for user request and it is connected through the database..

💬DataBase : Which stores the data
Two types of database: 
1.RELATIONAL DATABASE: 
stores in the tables format i.e It is organised data into a proper structure format rows and columns 
 Example: PostgreSQL, MySQL

2.NON- RELATIONAL DATABASE : 
It will not store in the form of tables format
Example: MangoDB, Cassandra 

HYPER TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCAL(Http) Methods : 
Http- It is not a secured website.

Https : it is a secured website.
ALSO I learnt http Requests:

✨Get : Request from the database fetching the data form the database 
Ex: Login process

✨Put : update - Modify the data or edit option 
Example : Edit the profile in any app or website

✨Post : Example saving the data into database system
Ex: Creating a account - sign up process

✨Delete: Removing the data from the data base 

Also I learnt the CRUD Operations: 
👉C- Create - Post request
👉R- Read - Get Request 
👉U- Update - Put request 
👉D- Delete - Delete request 

Today I learnt more about API
💬APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE(API) :
It is connection between client and server and it is also known as translator

Ex: Zoom App - 
Which sends the request and response in the form of javascript object notation(JSON)

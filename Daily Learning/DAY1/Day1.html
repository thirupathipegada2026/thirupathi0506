You all are know the websites right but Every websites has its own History.<br>


 Web History-<br>
~WEB 1.0 (1990s-2000 Generation)<br>
~WEB 2.0 ( Present Generation )<br>

<p> DAY2_ HISTORY & HOW THE INTERNET WORKS<br>
    Today l learnt and I explored the topics<br>
It Includes :
👉Client server Architecture <br>
👉Databases<br>
👉Http Methods<br>
👉Http Requests<br>
👉CRUD Operations<br>
👉 Application programming interface (API)<br>

Topic: CLIENT SERVER ARCHITECTURE <br>

💬CLIENT : Users side <br>
It means the request that we raise through any web or app <br>
Example: Swiggy - Here we can order something or requesting order from the specified restaurant <br>

,💬SERVER : It means the server give Response for users request <br>
In another words Server is a super computer which holds the data and give the response for user request and it is connected through the database..<br>

💬DataBase : Which stores the data<br>
Two types of database: <br>
1.RELATIONAL DATABASE: <br>
stores in the tables format i.e It is organised data into a proper structure format rows and columns 
 Example: PostgreSQL, MySQL<br>

2.NON- RELATIONAL DATABASE : <br>
It will not store in the form of tables format<br>
Example: MangoDB, Cassandra <br>

HYPER TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCAL(Http) Methods : <br>
Http- It is not a secured website.<br>


Https : it is a secured website.
ALSO I learnt http Requests:<br>


✨Get : Request from the database fetching the data form the database <br>
Ex: Login process<br>


✨Put : update - Modify the data or edit option <br>
Example : Edit the profile in any app or website<br>

✨Post : Example saving the data into database system<br>
Ex: Creating a account - sign up process<br>

✨Delete: Removing the data from the data base 
<br>
Also I learnt the CRUD Operations: <br>
👉C- Create - Post request<br>
👉R- Read - Get Request <br>
👉U- Update - Put request <br>
👉D- Delete - Delete request <br>

Today I learnt more about API<br>
💬APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE(API) :<br>
It is connection between client and server and it is also known as translator<br>

Ex: Zoom App - <br>
Which sends the request and response in the form of javascript object notation(JSON)<br>
